    <h2>Digits In Colors</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(167, 167, 167);"><i>November 2022</i></p>
    <p>Digits In Colors visualizes any number you input by breaking it down into its prime factors. This is called <b>prime decomposition</b>. Below, you can see an example of how a number is turned into a shape, with 45 as an example.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>This video explains the program's features, including the ability to reorder the hierarchy of the factors.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This method of visualizing shapes is the brainchild of Jacob Barnett, who is a former child prodigy. To my knowledge, he didn't consciously come up with the idea: instead, this is the way he just intuitively, subconsciously visualizes numbers.</p>
    <p>I first heard about this concept years prior in a video from Numberphile, and I noticed there were no available resources that could automatically generate these number diagrams so that we could see numbers through Jacob's eyes.</p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hP-DZMmQBng" title="Imagining Numbers as Shapes - Numberphile" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h2>Inaccuracies</h2>
    <p>If you watch the Numberphile video, you may notice that Jacob's method of visualizing 2 as a factor is different from how it works in my program. Unlike other prime factors, Jacob doesn't use a two-pointed shape (also known as a line) to represent 2. Instead, he duplicates the entire shape and overlays it on top of itself, rotated 180 degrees.</p>
    <p>I didn't want my program to work this way because, while it looks nice for the number 54, with other numbers it could make the diagram very messy very quickly. Using lines for factors of 2 also keeps the rules consistent so the concept doesn't get overly confusing.</p>
    <p>To be fair, Jacob didn't consciously invent this system (to my knowledge), so it's not like he decided to make the rules inconsistent. I've yet to see Jacob himself diagram any number other than 54, so maybe there are other quirks to his system that we don't know about.</p>
    <p>Maybe Jacob has some special form of synesthesia, which causes him to imagine shapes this way: synesthesia is known for having strange and inconsistent rules.</p>
    <p>I have synesthesia, and it comes in many forms, but my particular form is called grapheme-color synesthesia, which means that in my brain, every letter and number evokes a specific color that just feels like it naturally belongs with that symbol.</p>

    <p>I didn't choose the color scheme that I have, and I couldn't logically explain it, but I can say that it feels wrong to pair any letter with any color other than the one that it corresponds to in my mind. This diagram shows the results of a survey of 6,588 grapheme-color synesthetes, so you can see what colors are most popular for which letters:</p>

    <h2>Hallberg Award</h2>
    <p>This was one of the projects I made for the Hallberg award at Sierra College, which is an art scholarship that is awarded to four faculty-selected students. Recipients are given the opportunity to showcase their artwork at Sierra College's Ridley art gallery. Here's my work being displayed on some monitors:</p>
