    <h2>Musical Combinations Calculator</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(167, 167, 167);"><i>March 2020</i></p>
    <p>This program calculates how many possible songs you could write in one measure of music, depending on configurable settings like the time signature.</p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>The project was inspired by this Vsauce video from 2012:</p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DAcjV60RnRw?start=230" title="Will We Ever Run Out of New Music?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>In the video, Michael cites an article from 2000 that uses music theory to answer the question of how many songs could possibly be written. Here is that article:</p>
    <a href="https://everything2.com/title/How+many+melodies+are+there+in+the+universe%253F" class="db">Visit "How many melodies are there in the universe?"</a>
    <p>To define some boundaries around the problem, the author limits the possible songs to songs that are only one measure long, with a 4-4 time signature (common time), and with only 12 possible notes/pitches that are no shorter than 32nd notes. Notes also can't overlap to make chords, so this calculation would be appropriate for monophonic instruments like wind instruments.</p>
    <p>It's a great article, but I was curious about what the total number of combinations would be if you use different parameters from the author's (like different key signatures). That's why I made an interactive calculator, with configurable settings. The calculator uses this formula, which I'll hopefully explain in a future video:</p>
    
    <p style="font-family:monospace;color:yellow;">
      Total possibilities = (number of pitches + 1) * ( (number of pitches + 2) ^ (smallest note duration [as an integer] - 1) )
    </p>
    
    <p>If you plugged in the parameters from the article, my formula would give you this answer:</p>
    
    <p style="font-family:monospace;color:yellow">
      Total possibilities = (12 + 1) * ( (12 + 2) ^ (32 - 1) )
      <br>
      Total possibilities = 4,404,660,688,698,196,366,793,268,778,376,364,032
    </p>
    
    <p>That number <i>would</i> match the article's answer, if not for the fact that the article also allows the notes to slide from one pitch to a different pitch, like you'd do on a trombone, and my formula doesn't allow for that.</p>
    
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>Music is a lot more nuanced than either formula accounts for. Most songs have a lot of things that neither formula takes into account, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chords</li>
      <li>More than one instrument</li>
      <li>Changes in volume</li>
      <li>Changes in tempo</li>
      <li>Specific vocal intonations</li>
      <li>Lyrics</li>
      <li>Percussion</li>
      <li>Player instructions, like:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Legato</li>
        <li>Staccato</li>
        <li>Vibrato</li>
        <li>Pizzicato</li>
      </ul>
      <li>And many, many other things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These factors would explode the number of possibilities far past the thirty-seven-digit number above. Overall, there isn't really a single objective way to answer the question "how many songs could possibly exist?", but I think my answer could at least be considered a good lower bound, and it's a very big lower bound.</p>
    <h2>Tuplets</h2>
    <p>My calculator can't do a lot of things, but it can at least account for songs that have tuplets, like triplets and quintets. For example, you could allow for quarter-note triplets (aka crotchet triplets) by entering a "sixth" note as the custom smallest duration (or some multiple of six). That's because you could think of a quarter-note triplet as being one third of a half note, and 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.</p>
    <p>The calculator also allows you to change the time signature, which I wanted to mention because you may not notice it at first.</p>
