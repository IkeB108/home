Every word has 9 precalculated bitfields, stored as base-10 JavaScript Numbers. (Ignore the bitfields' first six digits, which aren't used).
Bitfield n stores whether the word has at least n occurrences of each letter in the alphabet. Example:

Word: Bagged
Bitfield 1: 00000011011010000000000000000000 ("bagged" has at least one occurrence of a, b, d, e, g)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Bitfield 2: 00000000000010000000000000000000 ("bagged" has at least two occurrences of g)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Bitfield 3: 00000000000000000000000000000000 ("bagged" has no letters with at least three occurrences)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

9 bitfields are also generated for the letter pool when it's time to generate word suggestions.

To check whether a word can be spelt with the letters in the letter pool, the program checks for any occurrences where the word has a quantity of letters that the letter pool doesn't (looking for a 1 above a 0). The bitwise expression for this is: word_bitfield AND NOT(letterpool_bitfield) i.e. word_bitfield & ~letterpool_bitfield. If this bitwise operation returns a new bit sequence of all zeros (which is a Number 0 in Javascript), then that means it found no mismatches between the word bitfield and letter pool bitfield.

Word bitfield 1 (bagged):         00000011011010000000000000000000
Letter pool bitfield 1 (adeggg):  00000010011010000000000000000000
                                       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The program finds a 1 above a 0 in the "B" slot, but nowhere else. It doesn't care about a 0 above a 1 (the letter pool has a letter that the word doesn't). If it doesn't find a mismatch in the first bitfield, it moves on to the other bit fields for higher quantities of letters.

TLDR bitwise operations in JS are not as fast as in lower-level languages like C or C++ but they are still pretty fast, often consuming fewer processor cycles than alternative methods. They aren't converted directly into machine code.

This whole method scales well with large letter pools because this method doesn't keep track of letter counts past 9. It doesn't need to care about whether any letters appear more than 9 times.

Another optimization method would be to use a trie to categorize words
