/*
Every word has 9 bitmasks, stored as JavaScript Numbers. (Ignore the first six digits of the mask, which aren't used).
Bitmask n stores whether the word has at least n occurrences of each letter in the alphabet. Example:

Word: Bagged
Bitmask 1: 00000011011010000000000000000000 ("bagged" has at least one occurrence of a, b, d, e, g)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Bitmask 2: 00000000000010000000000000000000 ("bagged" has at least two occurrences of g)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Bitmask 3: 00000000000000000000000000000000 ("bagged" has no letters with at least three occurrences)
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

On calculation, 9 bitmasks are also generated for the letter pool.
To check whether a word can be spelt with the letters in the letter pool, the program checks for any occurrences where the word has a quantity of letters that the letter pool doesn't (looking for a 1 above a 0). The bitwise expression for this is: word_bitmask AND NOT(letterpool_bitmask) i.e. word_bitmask & ~letterpool_bitmask. If this bitwise operation returns a new bit sequence of all zeros (which is a Number 0 in Javascript), then that means it found no mismatches between the word bitmask and letter pool bitmask.

Word bitmask 1 (bagged):         00000011011010000000000000000000
Letter pool bitmask 1 (adeggg):  00000010011010000000000000000000
                                       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The program finds a 1 above a 0 in the "B" slot, but nowhere else. It doesn't care about a 0 above a 1 (the letter pool has a letter that the word doesn't). If it doesn't find a mismatch in the first bitmask, it moves on to the other bit masks for higher quantities of letters.

TLDR bitwise operations in JS are not as fast as in lower-level languages like C or C++ but they are still pretty fast, often consuming fewer processor cycles than alternative methods. They aren't converted directly into machine code.

This whole method scales well with large letter pools because this method doesn't keep track of letter counts past 9. It doesn't need to care about whether any letters appear more than 9 times.

Another optimization method would be to use a trie to categorize words
