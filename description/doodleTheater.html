    <h2>Doodle Theater</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(167, 167, 167);"><i>December 2021</i></p>
    <p>Doodle Theater is an interactive website where you can puppeteer digital cartoon puppets using the mouse and keyboard.</p>
    <p class="warning"><i>Note: Right click twice to release a puppet.</i></p>
    <p>You can also play with up to two additional puppeteers by sharing the mouse and keyboard.</p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>VR and motion capture allow people to animate a digital character by translating their movements directly onto a digital 3D model. But I wanted to create a way to puppeteer digital characters that doesn't involve video motion capture, that's also simple, easy and accessible, with no special hardware or skills required.</p>
    <p>There are some existing projects that are similar to this idea while being pretty accessible, like Google's Blob Opera.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>I was also partly inspired when I learned about Waldo C Graphic, from MuppetVision 3D, which was one of the first digital characters controlled by an actual hand rig.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <p>Kevin Temmer's videos were also inspiring. In this video, he shows how 3D characters in Maya (a 3D animation software) can be rigged with custom controls to map cursor positions to mouth shapes and other movements.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <p>Kevin takes advantage of this a lot to make his characters have the same appeal as hand-drawn cartoons.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <p>Kevin has also made a few videos using actual digital muppets:</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had to do a little bit of playtesting to figure out what controls would work the best when there are three puppeteers. I was glad when I saw my younger cousins figure out how to do everything, including resizing and rotating the puppets, using only the keyboard (without too much difficulty).</p>
    <p>Another challenge was drawing every puppet with every pose from eight different angles (although some angles are mirrored).</p>
    <h2>Flaws</h2>
    <p>Ideally, this project should have a way to connect with other remote puppeteers online, instead of sharing a mouse and keyboard, but for me, that was too ambitious, because this was partially a proof of concept.</p>
    <img src="images/networkSymbol.png" alt="Two computers connecting remotely" class="di">
    <p>In theory, you could connect two keyboards to one PC to give your puppeteers more room, even though they would still have to use different control schemes. Or, if you planned to screen record a video of your puppets, you could have every puppeteer use a separate computer, and then use a splitscreen when you edit the footage to put every puppet in the same scene.</p>
    <p>The program is also not designed with keyboard layouts other than QWERTY in mind. Ideally, there should be customizable controls.</p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>If I were to do this project again, I think the next thing to add (other than online multiplayer) would be a way for users to create their own puppets.</p>
    <p>It would also be nice to make dynamic limbs, so that a puppet's arms or hair strands could dangle and wiggle around when it moves, similarly to a real puppet.</p>
